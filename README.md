Literature-Study-Feedback-Control
=================================
This repository holds the code and experimentation results of a literature study on
feedback control. The code is based on the [*Feedback Control for Computer Systems* book
by Philipp K. Janert](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028970.do), but rewritten
in Scala and using the [ReactiveX/RxScala](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala) library.
